# LLM ChatAgent > OData MCP Tool hosted on Azure Functions -> reporting experiment

This is a quickstart template to easily build and deploy a custom remote MCP server to the cloud using Azure functions. You can clone/restore/run on your local machine with debugging, and `azd up` to have it in the cloud in a couple minutes.  The MCP server is secured by design using keys and HTTPs, and allows more options for OAuth using EasyAuth and/or API Management as well as network isolation using VNET.
